# Data-Preparation-And-Analysis-Practice
This repository contains all the practice notebooks for D.P.A. It contains all the notebooks for preparing and analysis of data.
Data preparation, also known as data cleaning or preprocessing, involves transforming raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis. This includes tasks such as removing irrelevant or redundant data, handling missing or incomplete data, and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the data. Data preparation also involves tasks such as feature extraction, transformation, and selection, which are important for creating meaningful features that can be used for modeling or analysis.
Data analysis, on the other hand, involves using statistical, machine learning, or other computational techniques to explore, visualize, and extract insights from the prepared data. This includes tasks such as hypothesis testing, predictive modeling, clustering, and visualization, among others. Data analysis often involves iterative cycles of experimentation and validation, as researchers test different hypotheses and models to gain a better understanding of the data and to uncover hidden patterns or relationships.
